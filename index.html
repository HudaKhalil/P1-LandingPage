              <p>For some people, food is just a necessity to satisfy basic needs; for the others, food is more than just a basic necessity, but a pleasure that plays a significant role in their understanding of happiness. There are so many different cuisines and food preferences built by cultural and ethnical backgrounds, geographical locations and social classes. Food and popular meals can tell us a lot about the history and traditions of various nations and regions. India is a land of spices, Africa is a continent of sauces, Europe discloses esthetical beauty of food and opens up new opportunities and inventions for those who value and enjoy eating.</p>

              <p>Some of the recipes we keep through generations and these old traditions and knowledge are the only untouchable aspects that people try to bring with them.

            <p>A culinary art is the art of cooking. Culinarians cut, mix, paint, and color their meals, like artists. Like art, cooking is an artwork because they have to measure how much they have to cut. Sometimes cooking needs color for baking too. ... But the term “culinary arts” is more appropriate than when it's applied to being a pastry chef.</p>

            <p>Most people have a basic idea of what they need when they cook at home, but most people do not have the experience to know what's good and whats's not. <a onclick="return false" href="#">Cooking Tips</a> will help you with that process and keep you calm while you enjoy your recipe.</p>

                <p >A few weeks ago, I had some friends over for lunch. I hadn’t cleaned my house in weeks so before they arrived, I had to go into mad dash cleaning mode. For about three hours I were running around cut off dusting everything in sight. Our friends wouldn’t have judged us on the cleanliness of our home (they may not even have noticed), but you don’t want guests to have to experience – or witness – your messiness.</p>
